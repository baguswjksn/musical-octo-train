I was genuinely excited. I'd always heard that "big tech" meant working with the best minds and most efficient systems. But what I found instead was something I wasn’t prepared for: layers and layers of unnecessary complexity—half of which seemed actively designed to confuse.

From day one, the tech stack felt less like architecture and more like archaeology. There were overlapping tools and pipelines, old scripts nobody dared touch, and a patchwork of “temporary” solutions that had somehow become permanent. It wasn’t just legacy systems. It was intentional over-engineering. People seemed to take pride in the fact that no one else could understand the systems they built. And if I’m being honest, it started to feel like they designed it that way on purpose.

Every time I asked why a system was structured a certain way, the answer was rarely technical—it was cultural. “Oh, this is how we’ve always done it,” or “Yeah, that guy built it years ago, but no one really knows how it works anymore.” And yet, nothing ever got cleaned up. Every quarter brought new features, but no one ever talked about removing anything. There was this silent, unspoken agreement that complication equals importance. If your code was indecipherable, it made you irreplaceable.

Eventually, I started to realize what was really going on: the complexity was the point. It wasn’t just technical debt—it was job security. When you create systems that only you can maintain, you’ve built yourself a moat. And the deeper that moat, the harder it is for someone else to come in and take over. In a twisted way, it makes perfect sense. But it’s also completely toxic.

What’s even worse is that this mindset trickles down to new hires. Instead of asking how we can simplify, we’re trained to work around the mess. To adapt. To “learn the quirks.” But nobody stops to ask: Why are there so many quirks in the first place? Why aren’t we building systems that are easy to understand, easy to maintain, and easy to pass on?

There’s a quote that stuck with me during all this. It’s from the late Terry A. Davis, a controversial but undeniably brilliant mind behind TempleOS. He said:
“An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity.”

That quote hit me hard. Because it’s the opposite of what I saw in big tech. People weren’t chasing simplicity—they were running from it. Simplicity meant transparency. Simplicity meant documentation. Simplicity meant that someone else could take your place. And nobody wants that.

But here's the truth: real engineering isn’t about making things complicated—it’s about making them work. Making them understandable. Making them clean. The engineers I respect the most aren’t the ones who can build a 10-layer architecture with seven microservices for a basic CRUD operation. They’re the ones who can strip something bloated down to a couple of files and say, “There. Now it just works.”


Unfortunately, those engineers are rare. And often underappreciated. Because their work looks simple—when in reality, it’s the result of deep understanding and discipline. It’s easy to stack abstraction on abstraction. It takes real skill to remove what’s unnecessary and leave behind only what matters.
